### Description

**_@GitHub Copilot_** - Welcome @BanterBoy, I'm your Copilot and I'm here to help you get things done faster. I can identify issues, explain and even improve code.

You can ask generic questions, but what I'm really good at is helping you with your code. For example:

Generate unit tests for my code
Explain the selected code
Propose a fix for the bugs in my code
If you want to learn more about my capabilities and limitations, check out the Copilot documentation.

I'm powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. Make sure to verify any generated code or suggestions, and share feedback so that we can learn and improve.

#### Script

```powershell
<#----------
Evaluating Event Log Information

Get-EventLog provides access to the content written to the classic Windows event logs.
The most valuable information can be found in a secret property called ReplacementStrings.
Here is an approach to make this information visible so you can examine it and build reports.

In the example, the event ID 44 written by the Windows Update Client is retrieved, and the code outputs the replacement strings.
They tell you exactly which updates were downloaded, and when:
----------#>

Get-EventLog -LogName System -InstanceId 44 -Source Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient |

ForEach-Object {

    $hash = [Ordered]@{}
    $counter = 0
    foreach ($value in $_.ReplacementStrings) {
        $counter++
        $hash.$counter = $value
    }
    $hash.EventID = $_.EventID
    $hash.Time = $_.TimeWritten
    [PSCustomObject]$hash
}

<#----------
Always make sure you query for one distinct event ID: the information found in ReplacementStrings is unique per event ID, and you don't want to mix information from different event ID types.
----------#>
