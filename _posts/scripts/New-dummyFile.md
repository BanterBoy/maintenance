### Description

**_@GitHub Copilot_** - Welcome @BanterBoy, I'm your Copilot and I'm here to help you get things done faster. I can identify issues, explain and even improve code.

You can ask generic questions, but what I'm really good at is helping you with your code. For example:

Generate unit tests for my code
Explain the selected code
Propose a fix for the bugs in my code
If you want to learn more about my capabilities and limitations, check out the Copilot documentation.

I'm powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. Make sure to verify any generated code or suggestions, and share feedback so that we can learn and improve.

**_@BanterBoy:_** - Explain what the script does and why it is useful.

#### Script

```powershell
<# File System Stress Test
All Versions
This can be used to generate  large files for stress test purposes, you donâ€™t have to waste time pumping data into a file to make it grow. Instead, simply set the desired file size to reserve the space on disk.
This creates a 1GB test file:
#>
# Create a secure string for the password
$Username = Read-Host "Enter Username"
$Password = Read-Host "Enter Password" -AsSecureString

# Create the PSCredential object
$Credentials = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($Username,$Password)

# Server Variable
$Server = Read-Host "Enter Server Name"

# Create Remote Session
Write-Host "Connecting to Server $Server"
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName $Server -Credential $Credentials
Wait-Event -Timeout 5
Clear-Host
Write-Host "You are PSRemoting to $Server"

# create a test file
$path = "$env:temp\dummyFile.txt"
$file = [System.IO.File]::Create($path)

# set the file size (file uses random content)
$file.SetLength(1gb)
$file.Close()

# view file properties
Get-Item $path
```
