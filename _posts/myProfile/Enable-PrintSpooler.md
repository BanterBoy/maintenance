### Description

**_@GitHub Copilot_** - Welcome @BanterBoy, I'm your Copilot and I'm here to help you get things done faster. I can identify issues, explain and even improve code.

You can ask generic questions, but what I'm really good at is helping you with your code. For example:

Generate unit tests for my code
Explain the selected code
Propose a fix for the bugs in my code
If you want to learn more about my capabilities and limitations, check out the Copilot documentation.

I'm powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. Make sure to verify any generated code or suggestions, and share feedback so that we can learn and improve.

**_@BanterBoy:_** - Explain what the script does and why it is useful.

**_@GitHub Copilot_** - The code above is a PowerShell script that defines a function called `Enable-PrintSpooler`. This function takes in a parameter called `ComputerName` which is an array of strings representing the names of the computers on which the print spooler service should be enabled. The function is designed to be used in a PowerShell console or script.

The function is well-documented with a detailed description of its purpose, parameters, examples, and notes. The `CmdletBinding` attribute is used to specify the default parameter set and the help URI for the function. The `OutputType` attribute is used to specify the type of output that the function returns, which in this case is a string.

The function uses a `foreach` loop to iterate over each computer name in the `ComputerName` parameter array. For each computer, it uses the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a script block on the remote computer. The script block sets the startup type of the print spooler service to automatic and starts the service.

Overall, this function is a useful tool for enabling the print spooler service on multiple computers at once. It is well-documented and easy to use, making it a valuable addition to any PowerShell scripter's toolkit.

To improve the readability of the code, the author could consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code. Additionally, they could consider using more descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand. In terms of performance, the function could potentially be optimized by using parallel processing to enable the print spooler service on multiple computers simultaneously.

**_@BanterBoy:_** - Explain how to use the script and provide examples.

**_@GitHub Copilot_** - Certainly! Here are a few examples of how you could use the `Enable-PrintSpooler` function:

1. Enable the print spooler service on a single computer:

   ```powershell
   Enable-PrintSpooler -ComputerName 'COMPUTER01'
   ```

2. Enable the print spooler service on multiple computers:

   ```powershell
   Enable-PrintSpooler -ComputerName 'COMPUTER01', 'COMPUTER02', 'COMPUTER03'
   ```

3. Enable the print spooler service on all computers in an Active Directory domain:

   ```powershell
   Get-ADComputer -Filter * | Enable-PrintSpooler
   ```

   Note that this example assumes that you have the Active Directory module installed and that you have the appropriate permissions to query Active Directory.

These are just a few examples of how you could use the `Enable-PrintSpooler` function. The function is designed to be flexible and easy to use, so you can customize it to fit your specific needs.
