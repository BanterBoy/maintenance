    This example gets SPF records for all domains returned by Get-AcceptedDomain.

    [CmdletBinding(HelpUri = 'https://ntsystems.it/PowerShell/TAK/Get-SPFRecord/')]
    param (
        # Specify the Domain name for the query.
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true,
            ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true,
            ValueFromPipeline = $true)]
