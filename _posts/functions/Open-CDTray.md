#### Script

```powershell
<# Ejecting CD Drive
	All Versions of PowerShell
	Here is a fun little function that uses WMI to eject your CD drive.
	It does so by first asking WMI for all CD drives. It then uses the
	explorer object model to navigate to the drive and call its context
	menu item “Eject”:
#>
function Open-CDTray {
    $drives = Get-WmiObject Win32_Volume -Filter "DriveType=5"
    if ($null -eq $drives) {
        Write-Warning "Your computer has no CD drives to eject."
        return
    }
    $drives | ForEach-Object {
        (New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application).Namespace(17).ParseName($_.Name).InvokeVerb("Eject")
    }
}
Open-CDTray
```
