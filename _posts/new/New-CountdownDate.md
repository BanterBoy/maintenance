### Description

**_@GitHub Copilot_** - Welcome @BanterBoy, I'm your Copilot and I'm here to help you get things done faster. I can identify issues, explain and even improve code.

You can ask generic questions, but what I'm really good at is helping you with your code. For example:

Generate unit tests for my code
Explain the selected code
Propose a fix for the bugs in my code
If you want to learn more about my capabilities and limitations, check out the Copilot documentation.

I'm powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. Make sure to verify any generated code or suggestions, and share feedback so that we can learn and improve.

**_@BanterBoy:_** - Explain what the script does and why it is useful.

**_@GitHub Copilot_** - The code is a PowerShell script that defines a `CountdownDate` class and a `New-CountdownDate` function. The `CountdownDate` class has three properties: `CountdownDay`, `DaysUntilCountdown`, and `CountdownTime`. The `CountdownDay` property is a string that represents the date of the countdown. The `DaysUntilCountdown` property is an integer that represents the number of days until the countdown. The `CountdownTime` property is a `TimeSpan` object that represents the time of the countdown.

The `CountdownDate` class has a constructor that takes three parameters: `CountdownDay`, `DaysUntilCountdown`, and `CountdownTime`. The constructor sets the `CountdownDay`, `DaysUntilCountdown`, and `CountdownTime` properties to the values of the corresponding parameters.

The `CountdownDate` class has a `GetCountdown` method that returns an object that contains information about the countdown. The `GetCountdown` method first checks whether the `CountdownDay` property is set. If it is, the method tries to parse the `CountdownDay` property as a date. If parsing fails, the method assumes that the `CountdownDay` property is already a `DateTime` object. If the `CountdownDay` property is not set, the method calculates the countdown date by adding the `DaysUntilCountdown` property to the current date.

The `GetCountdown` method then calculates the number of days left until the countdown date and creates a new object that contains the current date, the countdown date, the countdown day, and the number of days left. The method returns the new object.

The `New-CountdownDate` function is a cmdlet that takes two parameters: `CountdownDay` and `DaysUntilCountdown`. The function creates a new `CountdownDate` object with the given parameters and calls the `GetCountdown` method of the object. If an error occurs, the function writes the error message to the error stream.

To improve the code, we could add comments to explain the purpose of each method and property. We could also use more descriptive names for the properties and methods. Additionally, we could add error handling for cases where the `CountdownDay` property is not set and the `DaysUntilCountdown` property is negative. Finally, we could add unit tests to ensure that the code works correctly in all cases.

**_@BanterBoy:_** - Explain how to use the script and provide examples.

**_@GitHub Copilot_** - Certainly! Here are a few examples of how you could use the `New-CountdownDate` function:

Example 1: Create a countdown for a specific date and time

```
New-CountdownDate -CountdownDay "2022-01-01" -CountdownTime "23:59:59"
```

This will create a countdown for January 1st, 2022 at 11:59:59 PM.

Example 2: Create a countdown for a specific number of days from now

```
New-CountdownDate -DaysUntilCountdown 30
```

This will create a countdown for 30 days from the current date and time.

Example 3: Create a countdown for a specific date and time and output the result to a file

```
New-CountdownDate -CountdownDay "2022-01-01" -CountdownTime "23:59:59" | Out-File "countdown.txt"
```

This will create a countdown for January 1st, 2022 at 11:59:59 PM and output the result to a file named "countdown.txt".

Note that you can also pipe the output of the `New-CountdownDate` function to other cmdlets or functions to further process the result.

#### Script

```powershell
class CountdownDate {
    [string]$CountdownDay
    [int]$DaysUntilCountdown
    [TimeSpan]$CountdownTime = [TimeSpan]::Zero

    CountdownDate([string]$CountdownDay, [int]$DaysUntilCountdown, [TimeSpan]$CountdownTime = [TimeSpan]::Zero) {
        $this.CountdownDay = $CountdownDay
        $this.DaysUntilCountdown = $DaysUntilCountdown
        $this.CountdownTime = $CountdownTime
    }

    [PSObject]GetCountdown() {
        if ($this.CountdownDay) {
            try {
                $CountdownDate = [datetime]::ParseExact($this.CountdownDay, "dd/MM/yyyy", $null)
            }
            catch {
                $CountdownDate = [datetime]$this.CountdownDay
            }
        }
        elseif ($this.DaysUntilCountdown) {
            $CountdownDate = (Get-Date).AddDays($this.DaysUntilCountdown)
        }
        else {
            throw "Please specify either CountdownDay or DaysUntilCountdown"
        }

        $Today = Get-Date
        $DaysLeft = New-TimeSpan -Start $Today -End $CountdownDate

        $output = New-Object PSObject
        $output | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "CurrentDate" -Value $Today.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy")
        $output | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "CountdownDate" -Value $CountdownDate.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy")
        $output | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "CountdownDay" -Value $CountdownDate.ToString("dddd dd MMMM")
        $output | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "DaysLeft" -Value "$($DaysLeft.Days) Days"

        return $output
    }
}

function New-CountdownDate {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
        [string]$CountdownDay,
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
        [int]$DaysUntilCountdown
    )

    try {
        $countdown = [CountdownDate]::new($CountdownDay, $DaysUntilCountdown)
        return $countdown.GetCountdown()
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error $_.Exception.Message
    }
}
