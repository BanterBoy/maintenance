Organising and Loading Functions

I put each of my functions in a single file and store those files within a single directory.
I use a naming convention for each file that ends with -Function.ps1.
Using this convention I can edit my PowerShell profile once to load all functions in that directory.
The obvious downside to this, is that anyone with access to your PowerShell function directory could drop code in there to be run each time you open PowerShell.

Inside my $Home\Documents\PowerShell\Profile.ps1 I added this line to dot source all my function files.

Get-ChildItem C:\Users\larntz\Documents\Scripts\functions\*Function.ps1 | %{. $_ }
